# Food-500 Cap: A Fine-Grained Food Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Vision-Language 

This repo contains the Food-500 Cap dataset for our paper: [Food-500 Cap: A Fine-Grained Food Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Vision-Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03151)(ACM MM'2023)

We provide the descriptions in two files (finetune_data.json, and evaluation_data.json). 
The images of the Food-500 Cap are from ISIA Food-500, you can download images from [here](http://123.57.42.89/FoodComputing-Dataset/ISIA-Food500.html).

Note:

In our paper we use all data to evaluate the VLMs. For the convenience of everyone's use and comparison, we have divided the dataset into train (finetune_data.json, 19760 pairs) and test (evaluation_data.json, 4940 pairs).
